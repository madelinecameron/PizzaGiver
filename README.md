# PizzaGiver

This project is abandoned for now. 

Dominos has no way of giving a tip through their API and all other pizza places do not have APIs and their code is purposefully obfuscated. 

There really is conceivable way around this besides wait for one of them to release a usable API or Dominos to add online tipping.
